    <h1>Chicken Cordon Bleu</h1>
    <img src="../chicken-cordon-bleu.jpg">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This entree is easy and delicious! It's one of my partner's favorites! Try to use the largest chicken breasts you can find so you'll be able to roll them easier.</p>

    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken cutlets</li>
        <li>Cooked ham</li>
        <li>Swiss cheese</li>
        <li>Bread crumbs</li>
        <li>Your choice of spices</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cover the chicken cutlets with plastic wrap and pound them with a mallet to create thin, even pieces. Thoroughly season the chicken with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Top each piece of chicken with one slice of Swiss cheese and one slice of ham. Roll the chicken vertically so that the ham and cheese are contained. Secure each roll with a toothpick.</li>
        <li>Arrange the chicken rolls in a prepared baking dish. Sprinkle liberally and evenly with breadcrumbs. Bake until the chicken is no longer pink, top each roll with half a slice of Swiss, and continue baking until the cheese is melted.</li>
    </ol>
